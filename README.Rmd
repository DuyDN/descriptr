## Overview

The goal of descriptr is to ease the process of generating descriptive
statistics and exploring statistical distributions.

## Installation

```{r cran-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install descriptr from CRAN
install.packages("descriptr")

# the development version from github
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rsquaredacademy/descriptr")
```

## Usage

### Descriptive Statistics

The following functions are available for generating descriptive statistics:

- `summary_stats`
- `cross_table`
- `freq_table`
- `freq_cont`
- `group_summary`
- `oway_tables`
- `tway_tables`


### Explore Distributions

Functions have been defined to visualize and compute percentiles/probabilities
for the following distributions:

- Normal
- Binomial
- Chi Square
- F
- t

## Credits

We have extensively referred to [R Packages][packages] by Hadley Wickham and
[Writing R Extensions][extension] while creating this package. The [devtools][dev]
and [testthat][test] package were of immense help. Before submitting the package
to [CRAN][cran], we submitted it to [rhub][rub] several times to ensure there were
no errors. We also went through the repositories of several R packages and learnt
a lot. Thanks to R commmunity, R Core team, R Consortium and Hadley Wickham.
